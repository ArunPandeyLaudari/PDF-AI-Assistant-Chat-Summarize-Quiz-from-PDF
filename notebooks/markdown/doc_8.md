# MICROCONTROLLERS MADE EASY

!Mixed A/D System Example

## Analog to Digital Conversion (A/D)
Analog to digital conversion (A/D) converts an external analog signal (typically relative to voltage) into a digital representation. Microcontrollers that have this feature can be used for instrumentation, environmental data logging, or any application that operates in an analog world. Various types of A/D converters can be found.

## Comparator
One or more standard comparators can sometimes be placed on a microcontroller die. These comparators operate much like standard comparators; however, the input and output signals are available on the microcontroller bus.

## Digital to Analog Conversion (D/A)
Digital to analog conversion (D/A) takes a digital number and converts it to an analog output. For example, the number 50 would be changed to the analog output of:

\[
\frac{50}{256} \times 5 \text{ Volts} = 0.9765625 \text{ V}
\]

on an 8-bit / 5 Volt system.

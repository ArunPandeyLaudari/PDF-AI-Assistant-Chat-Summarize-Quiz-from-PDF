# Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)

- The inter-process communication (computer application to computer application) of business information in a standard electronic form.
- In short, EDI communicates information for business transactions between the computer systems of companies, government organizations, small businesses, and banks.
- Using EDI, trading partners establish computer-to-computer links that enable them to exchange information electronically.
- This allows businesses to better cope with a growing avalanche of paperwork: purchase orders, invoices, confirmation notices, shipping receipts, and other documents.
- With the aid of EDI, all these documents are in electronic form, which allows more work automation to occur and even alters the way business is done.

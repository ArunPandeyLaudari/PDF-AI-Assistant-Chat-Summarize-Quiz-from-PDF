# Benefits of EDI

## Improved Problem Resolution and Customer Service
- EDI can minimize the time companies spend to identify and resolve inter-business problems.
- Many such problems come from data-entry errors somewhere along the way, and EDI can eliminate many of them.
- EDI can improve customer service by enabling the quick transfer of business documents and a marked decrease in errors, allowing for faster order fulfillment. It also provides an automatic audit trail that frees accounting staff for more productive activities.

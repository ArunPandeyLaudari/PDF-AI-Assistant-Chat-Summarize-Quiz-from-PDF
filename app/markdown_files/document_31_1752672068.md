# Value Chain Model

- Value chain selling is supported through two business models: demand chain and a supply chain.
- E-Commerce supports the transactions through both the demand chain business model and supply chain business model.
- Products, goods, services, or information are delivered through the parties of the value chain from producers to end users.
- A value chain also has relationship and administrative aspects; that is, you can manage the relationship of the partners or enterprises in your value chain, as well as offer some administrative services to those parties.
- As a result, value chain business models must manage the two sides of their businesses: their customers and direct sales, and their channel partners and suppliers. Each requires its own management channels and practices.

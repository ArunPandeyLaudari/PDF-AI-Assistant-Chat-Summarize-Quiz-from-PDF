# EDI Standard Layer

- The information seen at the EDI semantic layer must be translated from a company-specific form to a more generic or universal form so that it can be sent to various trading partners, who could be using a variety of software applications at their end.
- To achieve this, companies must adopt universal EDI standards that lay out the acceptable fields of business forms.
- What complicates matters is the presence of two competing standards that define the content and structure of EDI forms: the X12 standard, developed by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), and EDIFACT, developed by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN/ECE).

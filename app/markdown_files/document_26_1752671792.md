# Aggregator Model

- It is an e-commerce business model where a firm (that does not produce or warehouse any item) collects (aggregates) information on goods and/or services from several competing sources at its website.
- The firm's strength lies in its ability to create an 'environment' which draws visitors to its website, and in designing a system which allows easy matching of prices and specifications.

## Types of Aggregator Models

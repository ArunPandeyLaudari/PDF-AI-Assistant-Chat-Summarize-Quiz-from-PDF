# EDI Semantic Layer

- The EDI semantic layer describes the business application that is driving EDI.
- For a procurement application, this translates into requests for quotes, price quotes, purchase orders, acknowledgments, and invoices.
- This layer is specific to a company and the software it uses.
- In other words, the user interface is customized to local environments.

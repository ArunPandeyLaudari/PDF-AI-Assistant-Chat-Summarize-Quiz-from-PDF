# Processes in B2C (How Does B2C Work?)

1. **Visiting the virtual mall:**
- The customer visits the mall by browsing the online catalogue - a very organized manner of displaying products and their related information such as price, description, and availability.
- Finding the right product becomes easy by using a keyword search engine.

2. **Customer registers:**
- The customer has to register to become part of the site's shopper registry.
- This allows the customer to use the shop's complete services.
- The customer becomes a part of the company's growing database and can use the same for knowledge management and data mining.

3. **Customer buys products:**
- Through a shopping cart system, order details, shipping charges, taxes, additional charges, and price totals are presented in an organized way.

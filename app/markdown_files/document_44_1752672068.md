# Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)

- Many industries see EDI as essential for reducing cycle and order fulfillment times.
- In retailing, EDI can provide vendors with a snapshot of what stores are selling, enabling them to recognize and meet their customer's needs much faster than in the past.
- In addition, it enables retailers and vendors to place orders and pay bills electronically, reducing time and the expense of paperwork.
- The primary benefit of EDI to business is a considerable reduction in transaction costs, by improving the speed and efficiency of filling orders.
- Studies show that it takes up to five times as long to process a purchase order manually as it does electronically.

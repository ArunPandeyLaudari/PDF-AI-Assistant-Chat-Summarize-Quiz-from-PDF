# Consumer to Business (C2B)

- In this kind of a transaction, the consumers decide the price of a particular product rather than the supplier.
- This category includes individuals who sell products and services to organizations.
- For example, websites like monster.com, upwork.com, and merojob.com allow consumers to post their bio-data for the services they can offer.
- Any business organization that is interested in deploying the services of the consumer can contact them and then employ them if suitable.

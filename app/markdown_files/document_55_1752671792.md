# Benefits of EDI

## Expanded customer/supplier base
- Many large manufacturers and retailers are ordering their suppliers to institute an EDI program.
- Today, when evaluating a new product to carry or a new supplier to use, the ability to implement EDI is a big plus in their eyes.
- These same companies tend to stop doing business with suppliers who do not comply with EDI.

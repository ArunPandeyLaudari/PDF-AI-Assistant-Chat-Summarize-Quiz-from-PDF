# Why E-Commerce is Better

## 1. Multimedia Capabilities
Traditional commerce can’t offer multimedia like videos or virtual try-ons.
**Why It’s Better:** Richness makes e-commerce more informative and engaging, helping customers make better choices and increasing trust in the buying process.

## 2. Information Density
### Definition
Information density is the large amount of detailed, accurate, and up-to-date information e-commerce platforms can provide about products, prices, and customer preferences, often in real time.

### How It Makes E-Commerce Better
- **Detailed Product Information:** E-commerce sites offer extensive details (e.g., specifications, reviews, comparisons) that help customers make informed decisions.
- **Price Transparency:** Customers can compare prices across multiple sellers instantly, ensuring they get the best deal.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Businesses can update stock, prices, or promotions instantly, keeping information current.
- **Customer Insights for Businesses:** E-commerce platforms collect data on customer behavior (e.g., what they view or buy), allowing businesses to optimize offerings.
- **Example:** On eBay, you can see detailed product specs, customer ratings, and compare prices from different sellers in seconds.

### Comparison to Traditional Commerce
- Traditional stores have limited space for product details (e.g., small tags or brochures) and rely on staff knowledge, which may be inconsistent.
- Price comparisons in physical stores require visiting multiple locations, which is time-consuming.

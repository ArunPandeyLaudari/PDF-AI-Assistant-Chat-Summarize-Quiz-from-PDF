# Advantages of Business-to-Business (B2B)

## Scalability
- This means that the Web is open and offers round-the-clock access.
- This provides an access never known before, to the customer.
- This access is across locations and time zones.
- Thus, a company is able to handle many more customers on a much wider geographical spread if it uses an e-business model.

## Savings in Distribution Costs
- A company can make huge savings in distribution, logistical, and after-sales support costs by using e-business models.
- Typical examples are of computer companies, airlines, and telecom companies.

> **Note:** Due to the large number of transactions involved, B2B operations can be too risky if e-business applications cannot guarantee adequate quality of service in terms of performance, availability, and security.

2. **Real-Time Delivery:** Providing services or ads instantly when a customer is in a specific place.
- **Why it matters:** Quick responses catch customers when they’re ready to act.
- **Example:** Getting a discount alert while passing a shop.

3. **Personalization:** Tailoring services or ads to a customer’s location and preferences.
- **Why it matters:** Personalized offers feel special and increase the chance of a purchase.

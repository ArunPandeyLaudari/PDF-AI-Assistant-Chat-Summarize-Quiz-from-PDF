# Processes in B2C (How Does B2C Work?)

## 7. Shipment and Delivery
- The product is then shipped to the customer.
- The customer can track the order/delivery as virtual malls have a delivery tracking module on the website which allows a customer to check the status of a particular order.

## 8. Customer Receives
- The product is received by the customer and is verified.
- The system should then tell the firm that the order has been fulfilled.

## 9. After-Sales Service
- After the sale has been made, the firm has to make sure that it maintains a good relationship with its customers.

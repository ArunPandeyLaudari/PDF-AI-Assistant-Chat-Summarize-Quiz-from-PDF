# Benefits of EDI

1. **Reduced paper-based systems:**
- EDI can impact the effort and expense a company devotes to maintaining records, paper-related supplies, and the personnel required to maintain all of these systems.
- Electronic transactions take over most of the functions of paper forms and, through automation, drastically reduce the time spent to process them.
- EDI can also reduce postage bills because of the amounts of paper that no longer need to be sent.

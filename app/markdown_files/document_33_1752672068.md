# Advertising Model

The advertising model includes:

- **Classifieds**: List items for sale or wanted for purchase. Listing fees are common, but there may also be a membership fee. Examples include Monster.com and Craigslist.

- **User Registration**: Content-based sites that are free to access but require users to register and provide demographic data. Registration allows inter-session tracking of user surfing habits, generating data of potential value in targeted advertising campaigns.

- **Contextual Advertising / Behavioral Marketing**: For example, a browser extension that automates authentication and form fill-ins also delivers advertising links or pop-ups as the user surfs the web. Contextual advertisers can sell targeted advertising based on an individual user's surfing activity.

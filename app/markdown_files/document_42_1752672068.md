# Affiliate Revenue Model

- The process basically works as a link that is hyperlinked to the affiliate and is archived on a host platform that gets regular traffic.
- Any user who clicks the affiliate link is redirected to their website where the product or service is cataloged.
- The affiliate or the merchant thus pays an agreed commission to the host operator whoâ€™s carrying the link for every traffic driven.

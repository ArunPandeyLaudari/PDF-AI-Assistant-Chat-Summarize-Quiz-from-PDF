# Electronic Data Interchange versus E-mails

- EDI document transport is far more complex than simply sending e-mail messages or sharing files through a network.
- These EDI documents are more structured than e-mail.
- What really differentiates EDI from messaging is its emphasis on the automation of business transactions conducted between organizations.
- In addition, EDI messages have certain legal status.
- For instance, if a buyer sends a supplier EDI purchase orders that specify the requirements, time of delivery, and quantity and the supplier does not uphold its end of the contract, it can be taken to court with the EDI trading agreements serving as evidence.

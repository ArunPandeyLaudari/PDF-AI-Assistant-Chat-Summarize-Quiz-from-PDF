# Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)

- Despite these advantages, EDI is not (yet) widely used.
- It is estimated that out of millions of businesses in the United States, only 44,000 companies exchange business data electronically.
- Only about 10 percent of these companies use EDI for financial transactions.
- Electronic commerce is often equated with EDI, so it is important to clarify that electronic commerce embraces EDI and much more.
- In electronic commerce, EDI techniques are aimed at improving the interchange of information between trading partners, suppliers, and customers by bringing down the boundaries that restrict how they interact and do business with each other.
- Technically speaking, EDI is one well-known example of structured document interchange which enables data in the form of document content to be exchanged between software applications that are working together to process a business transaction.

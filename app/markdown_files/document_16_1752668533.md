# How Ubiquity, Richness, and Information Density Make E-Commerce Better Than Traditional Commerce

E-Commerce (Electronic Commerce) involves buying and selling goods, services, or data over the internet, offering distinct advantages over traditional commerce (physical, brick-and-mortar stores). The properties of ubiquity, richness, and information density significantly enhance e-commerce, making it more efficient, accessible, and customer-friendly compared to traditional commerce. Below, Iâ€™ll explain each property, how it benefits e-commerce, and why it gives e-commerce an edge, using simple language for your exam notes.

## 1. Ubiquity

**Definition:** Ubiquity means e-commerce is available everywhere and anytime through the internet, unlike traditional stores limited by location and hours.

### How It Makes E-Commerce Better:
- **Access Anytime, Anywhere:** Customers can shop 24/7 from any location (home, work, or while traveling) using a phone or computer, without needing to visit a physical store.
- **Convenience for Customers:** No need to travel or wait for store hours, making shopping faster and easier.
- **Global Reach for Businesses:** Businesses can sell to customers worldwide, not just those near a physical store.
- **Example:** You can order groceries from an app like Instacart at midnight, while a traditional store might be closed.

### Comparison to Traditional Commerce:
- Traditional commerce is limited by physical location and operating hours, restricting customer access and convenience.

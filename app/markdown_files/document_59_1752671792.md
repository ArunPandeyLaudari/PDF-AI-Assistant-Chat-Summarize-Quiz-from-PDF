## 3. Health Care EDI for Insurance Claims Processing

- Providing good and affordable health care is a universal problem.
- In 1994, the American public spent $1 trillion on health care, nearly 15 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP).
- National health care expenditures have risen by 10.5 percent each year for the past eight years â€” more than double the rate of increase in the consumer price index.
- It is estimated that $3.2 billion in administrative savings are expected to be achieved by switching from being paper-based to an EDI implementation.
- Employers could save $70 million to $110 million by using EDI for enrollment and to certify that a prescribed procedure is covered under the subscriber's health insurance contract.

# Processes in B2C (How Does B2C Work?)

## 4. Merchant processes the order
- The merchant then processes the order that is received from the previous stage.

## 5. Credit card is processed
- The credit card of the customer is authenticated through a payment gateway or a bank.
- Other payment methods can be used as well, such as:
- Debit cards
- Prepaid cards
- Bank-to-bank transfers

## 6. Operations management
- When the order is passed on to the logistics people, the traditional business operations will still be used.
- Things like inventory management, total quality management, and project management should still be incorporated even though it is an e-business.

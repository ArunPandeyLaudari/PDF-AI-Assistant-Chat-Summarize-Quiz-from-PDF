# Community Model

## Community Model includes:

- **Open Content**: Openly accessible content developed collaboratively by a global community of contributors who work voluntarily. [Wikipedia]

- **Public Broadcasting**: User-supported model used by not-for-profit radio and television broadcasting extended to the web. A community of users supports the site through voluntary donations. [The Classical Station (WCPE.org)]

- **Social Networking Services**: Sites that provide individuals with the ability to connect to other individuals along a defined common interest (professional, hobby, romance). Social networking services can provide opportunities for contextual advertising and subscriptions for premium services. [Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc.]

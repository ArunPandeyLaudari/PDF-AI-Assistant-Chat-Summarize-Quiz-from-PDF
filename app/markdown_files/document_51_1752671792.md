# Electronic Data Interchange versus E-mails

## Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
There is typically no human involvement in the processing of the information, as the interface has a software-to-software orientation. The data are structured in a software-understandable way. The interchange is composed by one software for interpretation by another software. If a reply is involved, it is composed by a software to be interpreted by another software.

## Electronic Mail
The data are not necessarily structured to be software understandable. A human-to-software interface is involved at a minimum of one end of the interchange. The message is composed by a human and/or interpreted by a human and/or a reply is composed by a human and/or interpreted by a human.

## Digital Signatures and EDI

- The cryptographic community is exploring various technical uses of digital signatures by which messages might be time-stamped or digitally notarized to establish dates and times at which a recipient might claim to have had access or even read a particular message.
- If digital signatures are to replace handwritten signatures, they must have the same legal status as handwritten signatures (documents signed with digital signatures must be legally binding).
- Digital signatures should have greater legal authority than handwritten signatures.
- For instance, if a ten-page contract is signed by hand on the tenth page, one cannot be sure that the first nine pages have not been altered.
- If the contract was signed by digital signatures, however, a third party can verify that not one byte of the contract has been altered.

# EDI Applications in Various Fields of Business

## 1. International or Cross-Border Trade
- EDI has always been very closely linked with international trade.
- Over the last few years, significant progress has been made toward the establishment of more open and dynamic trade relations.
- These developments have meant the lifting of long-standing trade restrictions.
- Many countries, and in particular developing countries, have made significant efforts to liberalize and adjust their trade policies.
- In this context, trade efficiency, which allows faster, simpler, broader, and less costly transactions, is a necessity.
- It is a widely held view that trade efficiency can be accomplished only by using EDI as a primary global transactions medium.

- Stock updates in traditional stores are slower, and businesses can’t easily track customer preferences.
- **Example:** In a physical store, you might not know if an item is in stock elsewhere or its full specs without asking staff.

## Why It’s Better

Information density gives customers more data to make smart choices and helps businesses respond quickly to market needs, unlike the limited info in traditional stores.

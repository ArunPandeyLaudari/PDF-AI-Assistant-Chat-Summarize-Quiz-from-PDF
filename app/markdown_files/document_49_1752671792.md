# EDI Transport Layer

- When the trading partner sends a document, the EDI translation software converts the proprietary format into a standard mutually agreed on by the processing systems.
- When a company receives the document, their EDI translation software automatically changes the standard format into the proprietary format of their document processing software so that the company can manipulate the information in whatever way it chooses to.

# MICROCONTROLLERS MADE EASY

## EXAMPLE: THE AUTOMOTIVE MARKET
The automotive market is the most important single driving force in the microcontroller market, especially at its high end. Several microcontroller families were developed specifically for automotive applications and were subsequently modified to serve other embedded applications.

| DASHBOARD DISPLAY         | VR02101F             |

The automotive market is demanding in terms of device performance and component reliability. Electronics must operate under extreme temperatures and be able to withstand vibration, shock, and EMI. The electronics must be reliable, because a failure that causes an accident can (and does) result in multi-million dollar lawsuits. Reliability standards are high - but because these electronics also compete in the consumer market - they have a low price tag.

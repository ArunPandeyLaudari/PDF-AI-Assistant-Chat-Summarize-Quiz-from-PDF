# Security and Privacy Issues of EDI

## Legal Status of EDI Messages
- There has been considerable debate concerning the legal status of EDI messages and electronic messages in general.
- Although a lot of work is being done on the legal framework, nothing concrete has come out of these efforts.
- No rules exist that indicate how electronic messages may be considered binding in business or other related transactions.
- The establishment of such a framework is essential if EDI is to become widespread.

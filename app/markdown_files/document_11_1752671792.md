# Processes in B2C (How Does B2C Work?)

B2C e-commerce is more than just an online store. It really is about managing the entire process, but just using technology as a tool for order processing and customer support.

## Steps in the B2C Process

1. **Customer identifies a need**
2. **Searches for the product or services to satisfy the need**
3. **Selects vendor and negotiates a price**
4. **Receives the product or service**
- Delivery logistics
- Inspection and acceptance
5. **Makes payment**
6. **Gets service and warranty claims**

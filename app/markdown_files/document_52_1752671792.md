# Benefits of EDI

- EDI can be a cost- and time-saving system, for many reasons.
- The automatic transfer of information from computer to computer reduces the need to rekey information and as such reduces costly errors to near zero.
- EDI transactions produce acknowledgments of receipt of data.
- Many firms are now finding that this acknowledgment can make the invoice obsolete and save many efforts now devoted to acquiring, receiving, and paying for goods.

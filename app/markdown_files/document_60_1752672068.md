# EDI Applications in Various Fields of Business

## 4. Manufacturing and Retail Procurement

- Both manufacturing and retail procurement are already heavy users of EDI.
- In manufacturing, EDI is used to support just-in-time (JIT). In retailing, EDI is used to support quick response (QR).

### Just-in-Time and EDI
Companies using JIT and EDI no longer stock thousands of large parts in advance of their use. Instead, they calculate how many parts are needed each day based on the production schedule and electronically transmit orders and schedules to suppliers every day or, in some cases, every 30 minutes. Parts are delivered to the plant "just in time" for production activity.

### Quick Response and EDI
Taking their cue from the efficiencies manufacturers have gained from just-in-time manufacturing techniques, retailers are redefining practices through the entire supply chain using quick response (QR) systems. For the customer, QR means better service and availability of a wider range of products. For the retailer and suppliers, QR may mean survival in a competitive marketplace.

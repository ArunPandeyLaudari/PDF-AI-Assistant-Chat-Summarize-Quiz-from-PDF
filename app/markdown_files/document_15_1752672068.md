# Business-to-Business (B2B)

- Involves electronic transactions for ordering, purchasing, as well as other administrative tasks between business houses.
- Includes trading goods, such as business subscriptions, professional services, manufacturing, and wholesale dealings.
- Sometimes in the B2B model, business may exist between virtual companies, neither of which may have any physical existence.
- In such cases, business is conducted only through the Internet. For example, Amazon.
